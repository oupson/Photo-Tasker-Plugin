/**
 *
 * Abstract superclass for a plug-in setting BroadcastReceiver implementation.
 *
 * The plug-in receiver lifecycle is as follows:
 *
 *  1. [.onReceive] is called by the Android
 * frameworks.
 * onReceive() will verify that the Intent is valid.  If the Intent is invalid, the receiver
 * returns
 * immediately.  If the Intent appears to be valid, then the lifecycle continues.
 *  1. [.isBundleValid] is called to determine whether [ ][com.twofortyfouram.locale.api.Intent.EXTRA_BUNDLE] is valid. If the Bundle is
 * invalid, then the
 * receiver returns immediately.  If the bundle is valid, then the lifecycle continues.
 *  1. [.isAsync] is called to determine whether the remaining work should be performed on
 * a
 * background thread.
 *  1. [.firePluginSetting] is called to trigger
 * the plug-in setting's action.
 *
 *
 *
 * Implementations of this BroadcastReceiver must be registered in the Android
 * Manifest with an Intent filter for
 * [ACTION_FIRE_SETTING][com.twofortyfouram.locale.api.Intent.ACTION_FIRE_SETTING]. The
 * BroadcastReceiver must be exported, enabled, and cannot have permissions
 * enforced on it.
